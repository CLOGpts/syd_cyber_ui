- Firebase Auth - Easy integration, good security
- Vercel + Railway - Fast deployment, good DX

### Deferred Items
- Microservices architecture - Too complex for MVP
- Kubernetes deployment - Not needed yet
- GraphQL API - REST is sufficient
- Real-time collaboration - Future feature

### Risk Items
- ATECO integration complexity - May need more time
- Visura extraction accuracy - PDFs vary widely
- Database migration - Need careful planning
- Performance at scale - May need optimization
